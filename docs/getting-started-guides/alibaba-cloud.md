## Alibaba Cloud Container Service

The [Alibaba Cloud Container Service](https://www.aliyun.com/product/containerservice) enables you to efficiently run and manage Docker applications on a cluster of Alibaba Cloud ECS instances.  It supports the popular open source container orchestrators: Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

If you want a simplified experience for cluster deployment and management, please consider trying [Kubernetes Suppport for Alibaba Cloud Container Service](https://www.aliyun.com/solution/kubernetes/). You can get started quickly by following the [Kubernetes walk-through](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/53751.html), and there are some [tutorials for Kubernetes Support on Alibaba Cloud](https://yq.aliyun.com/teams/11/type_blog-cid_200-page_1) in Chinese. 

If you want to use custom binaries or open source Kubernetes, please continue with the instructions below.
